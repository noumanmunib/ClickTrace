# ClickTrace - Function Call Tracker

**ClickTrace** is a simple tool that tracks and logs function calls in sequence after a user clicks a button. It shows the call stack as each function is called and also measures the execution time of each function.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time function tracking**: Logs each function as it gets called.
- **Call stack display**: Shows the current call stack at each point.
- **Execution time measurement**: Measures how long each function takes to run.
- **Handles asynchronous tasks**: Works well with delays and asynchronous operations.

### How It Works:
1. The user clicks the button.
2. Functions are executed in sequence, both synchronous and asynchronous.
3. Each function call is logged, the call stack is displayed, and the execution time is measured.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [REPO LINK]
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click the button and see how the function call tracking works in real-time.

### Tech Stack:
- **JavaScript**: Handles the function calls, delays, and logging.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure for displaying logs.

### Why I Built It:
I built this as part of a programming test to track function calls and showcase how JavaScript handles synchronous and asynchronous operations in sequence.
